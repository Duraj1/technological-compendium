# SiliconGraphics Octane2

## Date of Release
2000

## Brief Description
The Octane2 was the refresh of the original Octane workstation from SGI. Instead of the _Impact_ series of graphics processors,
it featured the new VPro system of graphics chips, significantly boosting processing power. Octane2s were most commonly found in
MRI machines and VFX offices, being the computer of choice for Discreet's Flame VFX compositor.
